Discussion of RAG Output Evolution

Base LLM Performance

The base LLM responses demonstrate fundamental limitations when addressing product-specific inquiries. While structured in presentation, these responses rely heavily on generic knowledge rather than contextual understanding of specific products. The model often produces formulaic lists of advantages and disadvantages that could apply to almost any similar product category. A notable weakness is evident in the second example, where the model shows confusion between product types, beginning with a reference to Blue Diamond Almonds before shifting to Haagen-Dazs Ice Cream. This inconsistency highlights the base model's tendency to hallucinate or conflate information when operating without supplementary retrieval mechanisms.

Basic RAG Improvements

With the introduction of basic retrieval-augmented generation, the responses show marked improvement in relevance and accuracy. Though noticeably briefer than the base LLM outputs, these responses incorporate specific product details sourced from retrieved documents. The integration of authentic information not present in the model's general knowledge creates a more grounded assessment. For example, the KIND Bars response mentions specific contextual details like their convenience "as a quick snack while working without having to leave the desk" - details that suggest real user experiences rather than generic product knowledge. However, these responses still lack comprehensive analysis and sophisticated structure.

Advanced RAG with Base Model

The implementation of an advanced agentic RAG system with the base model produces a significant leap in response quality. These outputs feature cohesive narratives with proper formatting elements like bold headers, moving beyond simple lists to synthesized overall assessments. The responses demonstrate enhanced analytical depth, considering multiple factors like taste, convenience, and price point from various consumer perspectives. However, a critical shortcoming persists in the base model's evaluation capabilities - it tends to extract and emphasize advantages while failing to adequately capture disadvantages. This imbalance results in somewhat biased assessments that emphasize positive attributes without sufficient consideration of potential drawbacks, limiting their practical utility for consumer decision-making.

Advanced RAG with LoRA Fine-tuned Model

The most sophisticated responses emerge from the advanced RAG system utilizing a LoRA fine-tuned model. These assessments exhibit refined structural organization with clear markdown headers and logical flow between sections. The fine-tuned model excels at balancing positive attributes with potential drawbacks, providing a more nuanced and fair evaluation. For KIND Bars, it specifically addresses considerations regarding "sweetness levels, chewiness, and price point" while including conditional recommendations based on consumer preferences. This approach acknowledges that product suitability varies by individual needs, offering targeted guidance rather than blanket endorsements. The improved organization and natural transitions between assessment points create a more readable and useful response for end users.

Progression of System Capabilities

The evolution across these systems reveals progressive improvements in several key dimensions. Information quality transforms from generic knowledge to specific, retrieved product insights. Contextual understanding deepens to incorporate authentic user experiences and perspectives. Response structure advances from simple lists to well-organized, cohesive narratives. Analytical depth progresses from surface-level observations to nuanced multi-factor analysis. Most importantly, relevance increases substantially, with responses becoming increasingly targeted to the specific products in question with each enhancement layer.

Impact of Fine-tuning

The fine-tuned model demonstrates qualitative improvements that significantly enhance the user experience. Its consistent structured format with clear section headings improves readability and information accessibility. The model exhibits better articulation of specific product attributes and more balanced presentation of positives and potential drawbacks. By including specific consumer considerations for making purchase decisions, the fine-tuned model provides more actionable guidance. The natural transitions between different aspects of the assessment create a more coherent and engaging response. Together, these improvements demonstrate how fine-tuning enhances the model's ability to deliver sophisticated, balanced, and practically useful product assessments that better serve diverse user needs.
